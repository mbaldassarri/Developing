# Smart Xmas Lights

This simple home automation project shows how it can be possible to turn on/off any lights you want at home.
An Android app (usable both with mobile and SmartWatch) allows to monitor the state of the light and change it. 
Server and Rasberry Pi code has been written using Nodejs. The server and the 'thing' talk together through MQTT protocol.
The rPi is connected to a relay which is responsible of turning on/off the light.

Enjoy :)
